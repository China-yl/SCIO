            <p>A great many ancient villages are vanishing in China with the country's rapid urbanization. In Jinxi county, a little-known hinterland in eastern China's Jiangxi province, there are more than 100 ancient villages and 10,000 ancient buildings
                being preserved today. The small county has a history of more than 1,000 years, and it is the hometown of Lu Jiuyuan, a philosopher in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) most known for his "My Heart is the Universe" theory. To preserve
                the many villages and buildings, most of which were originally built in the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1840), Jinxi county has in recent years developed a series of methods.</p>

            <p class="f">In Jinxi, most of the ancient villages have been decently preserved. In Houlin village, an ancient wall shielding invaders is still left undamaged, and within the village there's still a secret tunnel left, which can divert villagers to the
                backside of a mountain in times of emergency. In Hutang village, villagers still use a movable multilayered wall, another historical relic. Youdian village, the hometown of a high-ranking official in the Ming Dynasty, preserves many buildings
                with the imperial garden structure.
            </p>
            <p>Among all the ancient villages in Jinxi county, Zhuqiao village is now the most famous one. Located in the county's northern suburban area, the village has been named a national AAAA scenic area, hosting many tourists and photographers.

            </p>
            <p class="f">Moreover, a rich variety of ancient buildings have been found in Jinxi county. They include memorial gates, ancestral halls, temples, sacrificial altars, government offices, classcial learning academies, etc. In total, there are 124 well-preserved
                400-plus square meter ancestral halls, including 62 "da fu di" ― mansions built by high-level officials in ancient China. In Xuwan town, there are well-preserved ancient structures used during the Qing Dynasty as grain warehouses. Donggang
                village discovered a house with 24 courtyards, and Yinshan village unearthed a house with 99 doors.

            </p>
            <p class="f">Tile carvings, wood carvings and stone carvings can be seen everywhere in those ancient villages. Numerous sculpture techniques are used ― hallow engraving, circular engraving, embossment, openwork carving, etc. In addition to their exquisite
                shapes, those sculptures are more importantly known for their far-reaching implied meanings. For instance, the three wells located at the entrance of Zhuqiao village, with the shape of the Chinese character "pin," symbolize the ancestors'
                admonition of being a man with high morality.

                <br><br> Jinxi also implemented various government guidance and public engagement mechanisms. The county has initiated a number of polices and set aside special funds to boost the protection of its ancient villages. Meanwhile, it is encouraging
                entrepreneurs and private organizations to participate in the efforts and claim responsibilities to protect specific villages. The county has also sent special work teams to guide local villagers to protect their heritages. In 2017, Jinxi
                county raised more than 50 million yuan through fiscal appropriation, bank financing and absorbing private investments.

            <p>Yu Xuting, a carpenter living in Zhuqiao village with more than 10 years' experience of repairing ancient buildings, said he will try his best to play an active role in the plan of "Saving Old Buildings." </p>
            <p>Deng Zhihui, a village doctor and cultural protection specialist of Yangtian village, said repairing ancient buildings have not only saved cultural heritages, but also strengthened unity and created a harmonious atmosphere within his village.
            </p>
            <p>Today, there are more than 150 cultural protection specialists in Jinxi county, and more local villagers are continuingly joining the team. Some take on neighborhood watch duties at night, some study to improve their understanding of traditional
                Chinese culture, and some take out personal savings to repair old buildings. Furthermore, Jinxi county has enacted an array of strict regulations. Construction in cultural protection areas are prohibited, and the county is cracking down
                on the buying and selling of cultural relics.

                <br><br> Noticing the rapid development and many changes taking place in Jinxi, some young people who used to work in other places are choosing to go back home and starting their own tourism businesses. Novelty hotels are being set up
                in ancient villages, offering both comfort and convenience. Jinxi county is now ready to embrace more measures of preserving history and protecting its ancient villages, while boosting its tourism industry to another level.
