            <p class="f">In Jinxi, most of the ancient villages have been decently preserved. In Houlin village, an ancient wall shielding invaders is still left undamaged, and within the village there's still a secret tunnel left, which can divert villagers to the
                backside of a mountain in times of emergency. In Hutang village, villagers still use a movable multilayered wall, another historical relic. Youdian village, the hometown of a high-ranking official in the Ming Dynasty, preserves many buildings
                with the imperial garden structure.
            </p>
            <p>Among all the ancient villages in Jinxi county, Zhuqiao village is now the most famous one. Located in the county's northern suburban area, the village has been named a national AAAA scenic area, hosting many tourists and photographers.

                <span>Zhuqiao village is now a national AAAA scenic area. In recent years, the village has won the titles of China's Historic and Cultural Villages, Traditional Chinese Villages, and China's Most Beautiful Ancient Villages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="f">Moreover, a rich variety of ancient buildings have been found in Jinxi county. They include memorial gates, ancestral halls, temples, sacrificial altars, government offices, classcial learning academies, etc. In total, there are 124 well-preserved
                400-plus square meter ancestral halls, including 62 "da fu di" ― mansions built by high-level officials in ancient China. In Xuwan town, there are well-preserved ancient structures used during the Qing Dynasty as grain warehouses. Donggang
                village discovered a house with 24 courtyards, and Yinshan village unearthed a house with 99 doors.

            </p>
            <p class="f">Tile carvings, wood carvings and stone carvings can be seen everywhere in those ancient villages. Numerous sculpture techniques are used ― hallow engraving, circular engraving, embossment, openwork carving, etc. In addition to their exquisite
                shapes, those sculptures are more importantly known for their far-reaching implied meanings. For instance, the three wells located at the entrance of Zhuqiao village, with the shape of the Chinese character "pin," symbolize the ancestors'
                admonition of being a man with high morality.

            <p class="f">The CPC Jinxi County Committee and the local government have made every effort on the protection, renovation and tourism development of the ancient villages. Experts from both home and abroad are hired to compose a plan to investigate and
                evaluate the ancient villages, and the county has launched many infrastructure projects to improve road conditions as well as to provide water and electricity. Under the country's initiative to build a beautiful countryside, enormous joint
                efforts have been made to preserve the local culture and industries, with a focus on protecting the ancient customs and appearances to the uttermost.

                <br><br> Jinxi also implemented various government guidance and public engagement mechanisms. The county has initiated a number of polices and set aside special funds to boost the protection of its ancient villages. Meanwhile, it is encouraging
                entrepreneurs and private organizations to participate in the efforts and claim responsibilities to protect specific villages. The county has also sent special work teams to guide local villagers to protect their heritages. In 2017, Jinxi
                county raised more than 50 million yuan through fiscal appropriation, bank financing and absorbing private investments.

                <br><br> To make full use of the invaluable heritages, Jinxi county has put much energy in exploring the history and folk art of those ancient villages. Some old buildings have been renovated and now serve as village history museums, culture
                activity centers, agriculture museums, etc. Villagers are reaping the fruit of the county's tourism development, opening restaurants, selling specialty products and running homestays.

            <p class="f">In 2017, Jinxi county became one of the three counties countrywide included in the plan of "Saving Old Buildings" by the China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation, aiming to imbue new vigor in the protection of ancient villages.
                In the commencement ceremony of the plan, Wang Chengbing, deputy mayor of Fuzhou and secretary of the CPC Jinxi County Committee, said he would prioritize the protection of ancient villages in the county's cultural work agenda. He also
                stressed that Jinxi will undertake more measures to further explore and develop its own ways of protection, and integrate the county's culture with its economic and social development.
            </p>
            <p>Yu Xuting, a carpenter living in Zhuqiao village with more than 10 years' experience of repairing ancient buildings, said he will try his best to play an active role in the plan of "Saving Old Buildings." </p>
            <p>Deng Zhihui, a village doctor and cultural protection specialist of Yangtian village, said repairing ancient buildings have not only saved cultural heritages, but also strengthened unity and created a harmonious atmosphere within his village.
            </p>
            <p>Today, there are more than 150 cultural protection specialists in Jinxi county, and more local villagers are continuingly joining the team. Some take on neighborhood watch duties at night, some study to improve their understanding of traditional
                Chinese culture, and some take out personal savings to repair old buildings. Furthermore, Jinxi county has enacted an array of strict regulations. Construction in cultural protection areas are prohibited, and the county is cracking down
                on the buying and selling of cultural relics.

                <br><br> Noticing the rapid development and many changes taking place in Jinxi, some young people who used to work in other places are choosing to go back home and starting their own tourism businesses. Novelty hotels are being set up
                in ancient villages, offering both comfort and convenience. Jinxi county is now ready to embrace more measures of preserving history and protecting its ancient villages, while boosting its tourism industry to another level.
