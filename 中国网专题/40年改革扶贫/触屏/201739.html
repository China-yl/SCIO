  <p>Over the past four decades, China has made outstanding achievements in poverty alleviation through its reform and opening up, offering Chinese wisdom and solutions to global poverty reduction.</p>

  <p>According to the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, the number of poor people in China dropped from 770 million at the end of 1978 to 30.46 million at the end of 2017. A total of 740 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty, on average nearly 19 million people a year. The poverty headcount ratio also dropped from 97.5 percent to 3.1 percent, contributing over 70 percent to the global poverty reduction.</p>

  <p>Due to drought and water shortage in Xihaigu district of Ningxia Hui autonomous region as well as Hexi and Dingxi areas of Gansu province, the Chinese government initiated a poverty alleviation campaign by relocating villages in 1983. This move helped the local people out of poverty, achieved good economic, social and ecological results, and pioneered the practice of alleviating poverty by relocation. Since then, the relocation of poor people has become an important measure of poverty alleviation in China and has been gradually popularized.<br><br>In 2001, China carried out pilot relocation projects to alleviate poverty in Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Yunnan and Ningxia, and later expanded the scope of the projects to 17 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government). From 2001 to 2015, the central government subsidized a total of 36.3 billion yuan (about US$5.26 billion) and supported the relocation of over 6.8 million poor people.<br><br>According to a plan released in 2016 on relocation to alleviate poverty, nearly 10 million registered poor people will be relocated within five years, in order to address poverty in areas where people can hardly survive in local conditions.</p>

  <p>Since reform and opening up, to ensure poor people's access to education, the Chinese government has taken measures to promote balanced compulsory education, bridge the education gap between urban and rural areas, improve education infrastructure in impoverished areas and allot living subsidies to the students.<br><br>According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by 2017, the proportion of rural families in which all members above 16 years old didn't complete junior middle school was 15.2 percent; around 84.7 percent and 88 percent of rural families had easy access to kindergartens and primary schools respectively in their villages; around 89.2 percent of the villages had cultural community centers.</p>

  <p>Transportation in poverty-stricken areas has markedly improved. In 1978, the total length of rural roads was only 586,000 kilometers, and many towns and villages were not linked by roads.
